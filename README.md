# What's that Noiz?
Noizy is an experiment with sound generation using the SDL2 library.
You use the top two alphabetic rows of your keyboard to generate sound waves.
The combined waves are displayed in the window.
Select knobs by clicking them and adjust their values with your scroll wheel. Toggle spin boxes by clicking their arrows.
